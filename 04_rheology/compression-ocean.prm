# each compositional field.  Values for viscous deformation are based on dislocation
# creep flow-laws, with distinct values for the upper crust (wet quartzite), lower
# crust (wet anorthite) and mantle (dry olivine).  Table 1 of Naliboff and Buiter (2015),
# Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., v.421, p. 58-67 contains values for each of these flow laws.

# - young slab being subducted
# - flat subduction

# Important model parameters could be the position (parameter "x_plume" in
# the subsections Boundary velocity model and Boundary temperature model;
# you will need to change both together so that material flows into the 
# model at the same location where the temperature is increased) 
# and temperature (parameter "T_plume" in the subsection Boundary temperature 
# model) of the plume, but also the strength of the subducting plate 
# (third value in the lists of "Prefactors for diffusion creep" and 
# "Activation energies for diffusion creep", this is explained in more detail
# in the Material model subsection).

# There are two counteracting effects to consider here:
# Older (and colder) plates are denser, so more likely to sink down. 
# But the low temperature also makes ol plates more viscous, 
# so it is harder for them to break and start subduction.

# Important mode parameters could be:
# the stress acting on the overriding plate 
# (the function constant "stress" in the Boundary traction model), 
# how weak the existing weak zone is 
# (last entry in the "Angles of internal friction" list of parameters), 
# the age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere
# (the function constant "age" in the Initial temperature model)
# and the thickness of oceanic lithosphere.

# When discussing your results, keep in mind that for the first 
# subduction zone ever, slab pull does not contribute to the external stress.
